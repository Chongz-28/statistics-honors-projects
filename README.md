Analytics Assignment I (92% score): This assignment was used to test our knowledge of ensemble methods. Application of regression trees, random forests, bagging and boosting methods were used on datasets to carry out predictions. Hyperparameter assessment using the h2o package was carried out and various comparissions between these different machine learning methods was done. The full report and analysis done can be found in the Assignment I repo.
